synopsis: A pure Haskell PRNG.
description:
    This is a psuedo-random number generator (PRNG). It is designed to
    replace the standard Haskell '98 PRNG from the @random@ package. It
    has the following properties:
    .
    * Nicer API than @random@. (Supports all sizes of @Int@ and
    @Word@, for example.)
    .
    * Much faster than @random@. (In my tests, roughly 14x faster.)
    .
    * Comparable quality to @random@. (Both libraries pass the \"Die
    Harder\" suite of statistical randomness tests. In other words,
    neither has any overly obvious pattern to the \"random\" numbers
    it produces. Both libraries pass Die Harder with similar scores.)
    .
    * 100% Haskell '98 code. No compiler-specific features. No
    external dependencies. Builds everywhere.
    .
    * Pure functions and simple ADTs. No mutable state, no @IO@ monad.
    Simple API.
    .
    The actual algorithm is a lag-4 Multiply With Carry (MWC)
    generator, using 32-bit arithmetic. (Should be fast on 32-bit and
    64-bit platforms.) If my algebra is correct, its period should be
    roughly 1.46 * 10^48. (By constrast, @random@ claims to have a
    period of only 2.30 * 10^18.)
    .
    Note that this algorithm, by itself, is /not/ cryptographically
    secure.
    .
    Changes:
    .
    * Initial release.
